# Fixes Applied - October 24, 2025

## Issue 1: Client Creation Error - Column "full_name" does not exist ✅

### Problem:

The database schema uses column name `name` for clients table, but the backend controller was using `full_name`.

### Solution:

Updated `Backend/controllers/clientsController.js` to use correct column name:

**Changes made:**

1. `SELECT` queries: Changed `full_name` → `name`
2. `INSERT` queries: Changed `full_name` → `name`
3. `UPDATE` queries: Changed `full_name` → `name`
4. Search clause: Changed `full_name ILIKE` → `name ILIKE`
5. Order by: Changed `ORDER BY full_name` → `ORDER BY name`

**Affected functions:**

- `getClients()` - List clients
- `createClient()` - Create single client
- `updateClient()` - Update client
- `createClientWithVehicles()` - Create client with vehicles (walk-in form)

## Issue 2: Organizations Cannot Add Fleet Vehicles ✅

### Problem:

The OrganizationFormEnhanced component had no way to add vehicles when creating an organization.

### Solution:

Added complete fleet vehicle management to organization creation form.

**Frontend Changes (`OrganizationFormEnhanced.jsx`):**

1. **Added vehicle state management:**

   ```javascript
   const [vehicles, setVehicles] = useState([
     { vehicleType: "", makeModel: "", regNo: "" },
   ]);
   ```

2. **Added vehicle helper functions:**

   - `addVehicle()` - Add new vehicle to fleet
   - `removeVehicle(index)` - Remove vehicle from fleet
   - `updateVehicle(index, field, value)` - Update vehicle details

3. **Enhanced validation:**

   - Requires at least one vehicle
   - Validates each vehicle has makeModel and regNo

4. **Added Fleet Vehicles UI section:**
   - Dynamic vehicle cards with Add/Remove buttons
   - Each vehicle has: Vehicle Type, Make & Model, Registration No.
   - Visual indicators (green theme matching organization branding)

**API Changes (`Services/api.js`):**

Added new method:

```javascript
organizations: {
  createWithVehicles: (data) =>
    fetchAPI('/organizations/with-vehicles', {
      method: 'POST',
      body: JSON.stringify(data),
    }),
}
```

**Backend Changes:**

1. **New Controller Function** (`controllers/organizationsController.js`):

   - `createOrganizationWithVehicles()` - Transaction-based creation
   - Creates organization first, then creates all vehicles
   - Associates vehicles with organization_id
   - Validates license plate uniqueness
   - Splits makeModel into separate make and model fields

2. **New Route** (`routes/organizations.routes.js`):
   ```javascript
   POST /api/organizations/with-vehicles
   ```
   - Protected by authentication
   - Authorized for admin and receptionist roles

**Request/Response Format:**

**Request:**

```json

  "name": "ABC Transport Ltd",
  "contact_person": "John Manager",
  "email": "info@abc.com",

## Database Compatibility:

Both features now correctly use the actual database schema:

**Clients table columns:**

- `id`, `name`, `email`, `phone`, `address`, `created_at`, `updated_at`

**Organizations table columns:**

- `id`, `name`, `contact_person`, `email`, `phone`, `address`, `created_at`, `updated_at`

**Vehicles table columns:**

- `id`, `license_plate`, `make`, `model`, `year`, `color`, `client_id`, `organization_id`, `created_at`, `updated_at`
